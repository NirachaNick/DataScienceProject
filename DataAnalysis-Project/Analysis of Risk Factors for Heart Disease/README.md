# Analysis of Risk Factors for Heart Disease 
The purpose of this study was to use statistical inference to analyse data from the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 
which is a health survey that collects data on risk factors associated with heart disease from over 400,000 each year. 
Several statistical tests, including independent t-tests, Chi-square tests, and correlation analyses, were used to test 
the research hypotheses and investigate the significant associations between risk factors and heart disease.
The findings suggest that all risk factors used in this study are positively related to heart disease, except alcohol consumption,
which showed a negative relationship.
